# Silent Data Fetching Errors in Nested Next.js 15 Server Components

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 server components involving nested data fetching. When an error occurs in a parent component's data fetching, it might not propagate correctly to child components, leading to silent failures.

## Bug Description

The `nestedServerComponentBug.js` file shows how a failure to fetch data in the parent component (`ParentComponent`) silently affects the child component (`ChildComponent`). Instead of a clear error message, `ChildComponent` simply doesn't render correctly, making debugging challenging.

## Solution

The `nestedServerComponentSolution.js` file presents a solution using `try...catch` blocks to explicitly handle potential errors in the data fetching process. This ensures that errors are propagated appropriately, providing more informative error messages and preventing silent failures.
