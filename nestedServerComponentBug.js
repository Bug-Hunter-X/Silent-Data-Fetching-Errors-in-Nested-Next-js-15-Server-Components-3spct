In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with deeply nested data fetching.  If a server component attempts to fetch data that depends on data fetched by a parent component, and that parent component's data fetching fails or throws an error, the error might not properly propagate up the component tree. This can lead to silent failures or unexpected behavior in the child components, without clear error messages. This is especially problematic because debugging deeply nested server components can be difficult.  The error typically doesn't manifest as a clear exception but rather as missing or incorrect data in the UI.
